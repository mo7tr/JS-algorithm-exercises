# JS Algorythm Exercices

Mostly done on CodeWars.com, I keep a track of my algorythm challenges that I did in order to be able to jump in easily in case I'm forgeting about a problem I have to solve.

Also some are from the great Udemy course:

"JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass" from Colt Steele.

For each exercises, a solution from my behalf in script.js and one from the best practices in bestPractises.js

I'm running them through node.js so you need to use

```
var arguments = process.argv;

console.log(arguments);
```

and your argument pass in the CLI will be known as

```
arguments[2], ...

## Usage/Examples

```

node script.js yourArgument

```

You will need to insert in your script.js file:

```

var script = yourFunction(arguments[2], ...);

```

Happy Hacking ^^
